        "\n",
        "####  Spot Trends and Ranges\n",
        "- Measures like **mean**, **median**, **min**, and **max** show the typical values and range for each variable, helping us understand scale and variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Detect Skewed Data\n",
        "- **Skewness** tells us whether the distribution is symmetrical or lopsided. For example, disease rates or contaminant levels may be heavily skewed in certain regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Identify Outliers and Heavy Tails\n",
        "- **Kurtosis** shows if a variable has more extreme values than a normal distribution, which is crucial when working with public health or environmental data where outliers might signal crises.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Validate Assumptions\n",
        "- Summary statistics can confirm if the data matches expectations (e.g. pH levels within safe biological limits, reasonable GDP values).\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these metrics guide decisions on:\n",
        "- Which features may need transformation\n",
        "- Which variables could drive meaningful insights\n",
        "- Whether data normalisation or outlier handling is required\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Red Flags\n",
        "- Some variables like `Diarrheal Cases`, `Cholera Cases`, and `Bacteria Count` have **minimums at 0**, which might suggest under-reporting or areas with no observed cases. Maybe we will need to keep this in mind during hypothesis testing.\n"
